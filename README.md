# Multipartite Viruses

These scripts were created as a part of my master thesis (with [Tomas Alarcon] (https://www.icrea.cat/Web/ScientificStaff/tomas-alarcon-210760) as my supervisor and [Josep Sardanyes] (http://complex.upf.es/~josep/Site/Welcome.html) as my co-supervisor. The scripts are used to analysis the determinsitic models for the behaviour of multipartite viruses. More info about multipartie viruses : [A.
