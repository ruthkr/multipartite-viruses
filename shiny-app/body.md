Crime Data Analysis is an already established yet flourishing topic in the United States. Despite that, there is no public user-friendly global data hub to visualise crime statistics across the US territory. 
The goal of this project is to develop visualisation tools in order to further ease the access to already open data in order to provide a dynamic time series visualisation of the evolution of crime in different cities of the US.

In this app you can:

- Visualise the crime statistics for a single city.
- Compare cities to see how crime statistics change throughout the different regions of the US.
- Easily look for temporal patterns.

It is worth to notice that this is a humble proof of concept. In the near future we would like to include more cities and provide a method to visualise and export the raw data.
